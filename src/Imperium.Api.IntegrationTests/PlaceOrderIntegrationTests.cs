// Test removed per user instruction - it was flaky in CI due to timing with background services and in-memory SQLite.
// If you want to re-enable a stable version later, consider moving this to an explicit integration test run with
// a hardened WebApplicationFactory that disables hosted services and ensures DB migrations run before starting.
